## F.A.Q.

<details>
	<summary>Mobile first or desktop first?</summary>
	<p>this library does not take a mobile-first approach. It also does not use a desktop-centric approach. But there is an opportunity to apply one or another approach in the library. Read the instructions carefully. The library combines both approaches.</p>
	<h4>Benefits of this approach</h4>
	<p>Faster rendering speed</p>
	<p><i>Since you don't need to apply styles and then overwrite them</i></p>
	<p>Since you don't need to apply styles and then overwrite them</p>
	<p>You don't have to think about which approach to use.</p>
	<p><i>since the hybrid approach is backward compatible with any of the approaches</i></p>
	<br />
	<h4>Disadvantages of this approach</h4>
	<p>increases file size almost insignificantly</p>
	<p><i>due to the use of both the minimum and maximum value</i></p>

	<p>Check if the library is connected correctly</p>
